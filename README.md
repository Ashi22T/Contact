<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
      In this application, which is a little more complex, I learned and also reinforced many previous lessons.<br>
      I used new widgets, resources and this example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), made me learn a lot, it will certainly be a learning experience that I will take with me in all the technologies that I will learn. <br>
      In this project I also used the SQLite database, with the Flutter plugin, the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/persistence/sqlite"> sqflite</a>, which will help insert, query, update and delete queries.
